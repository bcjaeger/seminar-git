# .larger[What is Git]

---
class: middle 

# Git is a .blue[version control system]

- It is an application that runs on your computer, just like Microsoft Word or Google Chrome.

- Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. 

---

# .larger[What does<br/>Git do]

---
class: middle

# Git manages the evolution of a set of files (.blue[repository])

Imagine “Track Changes” from Microsoft Word on a whole directory instead of just one file.
